			<p><strong>Sorry, it's still a bit dusty here.</strong> But we're working on something we think is important! </p>
			<hr>
			<p>In recent years, there's been a resurgence in white supremacy and hate group activity. Government and law enforcement lack either the power or will do fight it effectively. Businesses who give support or services to these hate groups often do so with impunity. <strong>It's time for all of us to fight them.</strong></p>
			<p>To do that, we're working together to build a comprehensive database of companies who aid, in any way, these evil organizations. We're going to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pull together existing lists/databases of offending companies</li>
				<li>Connect company profiles to articles by investigative journalists</li>
				<li>Include fact check links</li>
				<li>Encourage the community to share their own stories</li>
				<li>Integrate with <a href="https://opensecrets.org" target="_blank">opensecrets.org</a> to gather information about political lobbying and contributions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Stay tuned for more updates soon!</strong></p>
